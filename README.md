# Smart Vendor Finder – Intelligent Supply Chain System 🔍🧠

**Smart Vendor Finder** is a powerful open-source platform that connects users with **verified local vendors** using **blockchain payments, AI-based recommendations**, and **real-time demand forecasting**. This project was originally developed as part of a hackathon to modernize inventory and vendor management using intelligent systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Vendors list products on the platform.
2. Buyers/employees browse and purchase verified items.
3. The system converts the price to ETH and transfers via blockchain (Alchemy node).
4. Products are added to the inventory database.
5. Sales data is analyzed to forecast demand.
6. The system recommends restocking only what’s required.
